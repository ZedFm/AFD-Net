# AFD-Net
Self-attention based neural network for full-waveform echo decomposition

#### Due to the constraints imposed by confidentiality regulations, we are sorry that it is not feasible to fully disclose the coding, pretrained weights, and the graphical user interface (GUI) form of FW-GenTools in this Repository.

####  But we present the PyTorch implementations of both the classification and decomposition modules within the AFD-Net architecture. Additionally, we provide the core code from FW-GenTools that is employed in the generation of individual simulated echo signals.

Readers are encouraged to consult this code and adapt it to real-world applications by setting the function parameters via stochastic processes, thereby facilitating the creation of tailored waveform training datasets.

###### The Codes will be implemented soon.
